A Biometric Authenticator App is a mobile application that utilizes biometric data, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, to authenticate and verify the identity of users. This type of app provides an additional layer of security by replacing traditional passwords or PINs with biometric information, which is unique to each individual.

The primary feature of a biometric authenticator app is the ability to authenticate users based on their biometric data. This can include fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, voice recognition, or iris scanning.
